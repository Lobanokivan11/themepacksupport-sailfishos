# Theme pack support for Sailfish OS

The script works by replacing default elements with custom ones and enables safe backup/restore. A GUI is available [here](https://fravaccaro.github.io/sailfishos-uithemer/).

## Create custom theme packs

Documentation on how to create theme packs available [here](docs/getstarted.md).

## Builds

Builds available on [OpenRepos](https://openrepos.net/content/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos).

## Side notes

I chose this approach as no proper documentation on theming support in Sailfish OS has been found yet.

However, a rudimentary theme support may have been already built-in, since I found sailfish-default folders to have an index.theme package and dconf to have values for those themes. Further investigation is needed.

## Roadmap

Roadmap and features will be tracked on the [Trello dashboard](https://trello.com/b/yrXVjXbL).
