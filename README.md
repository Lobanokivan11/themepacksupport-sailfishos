# Theme pack support for Sailfish OS.

The script works by replacing default elements with custom ones and enables safe backup/restore. 

A GUI is available [here](https://github.com/fravaccaro/sailfishos-uithemer).

## Features

- Icon theming.
- Font theming.
- Sound theming (needs further testing).
- Change device pixel ratio.
- Change DPI for Alien Dalvik.
- Options to recover UI.

## Create custom theme packs

Documentation on how to create theme packs available [here](https://github.com/fravaccaro/themepacksupport-sailfishos/wiki/Get-started).

## Side notes

I chose this approach as no proper documentation on theming support in Sailfish OS has been found yet.

However, a rudimentary theme support may have been already built-in, since I found sailfish-default folders to have an index.theme package and dconf to have values for those themes. Further investigation is needed.

## Roadmap
- Ensure compatibility with Intex Aqua Fish.
